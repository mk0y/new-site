Rules for .astro files:

```astro
---
// between these lines goes init section for imports and all that
// server side prep
import { this, that } from "something";
const foobar = that("prop");
---

<section>
  <div>Here goes regular HTML</div>
</section>
```

Components are in src/components folder.
When we build them we always include i18n props, like so:

```
<Component
  title={i18nData.common.title}
  type={i18nData.something.else}
/>
```

Additionally we always update src/i18n.de.json and src/i18n.en.json files.

Performance Optimization:
  - Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage Astro's static generation.
  - Use the client:* directives judiciously for partial hydration:
    - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
    - client:idle for non-critical interactivity
    - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible
  - Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
  - Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features.

SEO and Meta Tags
  - Use Astro's <head> tag for adding meta information.
  - Implement canonical URLs for proper SEO.
  - Use the <SEO> component pattern for reusable SEO setups.

When creating svg icons put them in src/icons folder for reusability.

Never change irrelevant code or code that is wrote by 3rd party. Focus on new code and wait for refactoring instructions instead.

Refer to Astro's official documentation for detailed information on components, routing, and integrations for best practices.
